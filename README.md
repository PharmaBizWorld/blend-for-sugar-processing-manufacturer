Ingredients and Their Functions
Fungal Alpha-Amylase:
Role: This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch molecules into smaller dextrins and simple sugars. It is vital for breaking down complex carbohydrates, ensuring efficient starch conversion during sugar production.
Benefits: Reduces viscosity, enhances yield, and accelerates processing time.
Acid Cellulase:
Role: Acid cellulase targets cellulose components, breaking them into fermentable sugars. This is especially important for processes that involve the extraction of sugar from plant materials containing fibrous elements.
Benefits: Increases extraction efficiency and reduces energy consumption during the process.
Acid Protease:
Role: This enzyme hydrolyzes proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, aiding in clarifying the sugar solution and removing unwanted impurities.
Benefits: Improves clarity and ensures a high-quality end product.
